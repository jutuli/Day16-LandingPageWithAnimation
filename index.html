      <h2>Every Idea</h2>
      <img src="./assets/img/idea.png" alt="Lightbulb" />
      <h2>Starts with A need</h2>
      <p>
        Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could
        improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start
        designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored
        on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that
        makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers
        (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the
        idea, but the problem was that the result was just something nice and
        did not solve any problem.
      </p>
      <h2>
        After several weeks of sticking to this challenge, I learned a lot

          <h4>Start with asking why</h4>
          <p>
            You will start seeing things differently and coming up with more
            effective ways of achieving goals.

          <h4>Your ideas will have more value</h4>
          <p>
            By looking at problems from a different perspective, your ideas will
            be fresher and more valuable.

          <h4>Design solutions with love</h4>
          <p>
            Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the
            frustration of the users and resolve to end it.

          <h4>Share and show your work</h4>
          <p>
            As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not
            finished or doesn’t look perfect. You will learn to accept feedback
            and learn from it.

        create a solution to any problem you yourself are facing and show the

        <h4>Find your problem</h4>
        <p>
          It has to be a problem that’s personally affecting or affected you,
          like finding your keys, calling a taxi or even remembering something.
          Open your eyes, look around you carefully and pay close attention to
          your surroundings.

        <p>
          It's time to look for solutions. What can you do to solve these
          problems? It's time to think out of the box, grab your notebook and
          start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.

          How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about
          features and functionality, and then start designing. Don’t forget to
          always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
